# Intro to my freeCodeCamp Projects
As I work my way through a number of freeCodeCamp courses I will be pushing them here for my current and future benefit. They are all still works in progress, in future I plan to revisit and update them by turning them into presentable, interactive webpages with good styling. For now though, this is on the backburner.

## fcc-palindrome-checker
- The goal: To create a working, interactive palindrome checker webpage.
- Difficulties faced: None, honestly.
- What I learned: Refreshed knowledge on using regex inside of filter. Took a moment to realise I could use .test method
- How I plan to improve: Create webpage with styling and prompt users
